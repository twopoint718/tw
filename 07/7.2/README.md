You may either run tests by:

```
make
```

...which will install `elm-test` via `npm` and then run the tests.
You could also cut to the chase and install `elm-test` directly via:

```
npm install -g elm-test
elm-test Tests.elm
```

`Tests.elm` verifies that the code in the Elm chapter of the book is well-behaved.
